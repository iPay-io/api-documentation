# Security Token (Optional)

For each API key, iPay provides a **webhook secret token** to enhance security. This token is included in every JSON payload sent to your IPN URL.

:::note
**Validating this token ensures notifications originate from iPay and are untampered.**
:::

Obtain the token from your iPay account manager when your API key is issued. Store it securely. When receiving an HTTP POST callback, compare the payloadâ€™s token to your stored token to verify authenticity.

:::info
Implementing the token check is **optional** but **highly recommended**. Without it, protect your IPN endpoint with measures like IP whitelisting.
:::

**Example Verification (Pseudo-code)**:
```python
if payload['token'] == stored_secret_token:
    process_payment(payload)
else:
    reject_callback()
```
