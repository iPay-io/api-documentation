# Creating an API Key

With a company and account configured, create an **API Key** to link your integration components.

Go to the **API Key** Menu --> 🗝

1. Select your **Account** from the dropdown
2. Enter your **callback URL** for HTTP POST notifications.
--> Click on the **Request** button to complete

The system generates a unique API key.
