# Registering a User

Start by creating an **iPay user account**.

Contact iPay via the **Apply Now** form at [i-pay.io](https://i-pay.io/) or through your iPay representative to set up an account for you or your business.

Once iPay confirms account creation, log in:
1. Visit [dash.i-pay.io](https://dash.i-pay.io/) and click **“Forgot password”**.
2. Set your password using the emailed link.
3. Log in to access the i-pay backoffice dashboard.

The dashboard is your hub for configuring companies, wallets, and API keys.
