# Adding a Crypto Wallet

With your company set up, add a **crypto wallet** to receive payments.

Go to the **Companies** Menu (ðŸ‘¤), and click on **+ Open New Account** next to your Company's name.

Enter the name of the Account (e.g. "CRM Deposits"), click on **Polygon USDT**, and enter your **own wallet address**.

**Note**: The provided wallet address can be generated from any wallet provider you may chose. 
Funds from customer purchases are sent directly to this address. 

:::warning
Double-check the wallet address; iPay forwards funds exactly as provided.
:::

iPay generates an **Account ID** for each wallet, used in callback data to identify payment destinations.
