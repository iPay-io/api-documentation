# Registering a Company

After logging in, register your **Company** in the i-pay dashboard to represent your business or project.

Navigate to the **Companies** or **Profile** section and enter details like company name and address. If your account was pre-associated with a company, details may be pre-populated; otherwise, add a new company.

This company profile links to your user account and owns configured wallets and API keys.
