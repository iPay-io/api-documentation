# Overview

Welcome to the i-pay Payment Gateway documentation. This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough for integrating the i-pay platform ([i-pay.io](https://i-pay.io/)) into your systems, enabling you to accept cryptocurrency payments delivered directly to your crypto wallet.

The integration process is straightforward:
1. **Generate a REST API URL**: Create a payment URL to initiate transactions.
2. **Set Up HTTP POST Callbacks**: Configure a listener to receive instant payment notifications.

The i-pay dashboard, accessible at [dash.i-pay.io](https://dash.i-pay.io/), is used for configuration and monitoring only. It never controls funds, allowing safe access sharing with your team.

All funds flow directly to **your wallet**, ensuring you maintain full control.
